    "The BGRA image frames were processed by removing the alpha channel and converting the HSV color space [Figure 1], creating a lane mask to detect the yellow center line [Figure 2]. A region of interest focuses on the bottom half of the frame and Canny edge detection is used to determine the lane edges. Finally, a sliding window algorithm tracks lane positionsby identifying lane pixels in successive windows. Originally we attempted to use a combined mask to detect both the solid yellow lane line and the dotted white lane lines. However, due to the resolution of the simulated camera in Webots, the white line proved too difficult to detect consistently and was removed from the lane mask. The center of the lane was calculated by determining a fixed pixel distance from the yellow center lane line rather than the center of the two lane lines. "

Using the LiDAR's field of view (FOV) and the index of the minimum distance, the angle of the nearest obstacle is calculated and converted from radians to degrees.

    "The state space had 6 total variables: `speed`, `gps`, `lidar_dist`, `lidar_angle`, `lane_deviation`, `lane_mask`. The number of obervations was dependent on the number of episodes the agent trained and how many steps each epsiode lasted. Webots by default runs at 32ms per time step, meaning approximately 31 observations will be recorded per 1 second of simulation time. The most critical values are `lane_deviation`, `speed`, and `lidar_dist` since these variabes are the most crucial in encouraging the agent to make foward progress and to reach the goal without crashing. All three of these variables are represented in the state space as a 1D float array. \n",

The set steering angle is also smoothed, meaning that changes are capped to +/- 0.1 radians to allow for smooth turning. The speed ranges from 0 to 150 km/h, however to ensure that the cruising speed does not jump back and forth to the extremes, cruising speed changes are limited 75.0 km/h maximum. "

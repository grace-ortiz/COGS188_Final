    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",

A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Background - Jiawei\n",
    "Autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize transportation by reducing human driving errors and improving traffic efficiency. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are about 94% of road accidents are caused by human errors, which indicates the potential safety benefits of self-driving technology. However, despite the advancements in AI algorithms, how to ensure safety and reliability of self-driving technology, and also make perfect decisions remains a significant challenge, especially in complex, multi-agent environments where vehicles interact with a mass of unpredictable human drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians<a name=\"shalev\"></a><sup>[1]</sup>. Algorithms must dynamically adjust to current environments such as uncontrolled intersections, lane merging, or sudden braking from other vehicles. Therefore, a robust decision-making system is crucial for the success.\n",
    "\n",
    "One promising approach to enhancing the realiability of decision-making is through deep reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike traditional rule-based systems, which rely on handcrafted heuristics, RL allows vehicles to learn from experience and optimize their actions over time. El Sallab et al. propose an RL-based framework that integrates recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to improve decision-making in partially observable environments<a name=\"sallab\"></a><sup>[1]</sup>. This framework helps autonomous vehicles remember past information, which is crucial in some complicated scenarios like hidden pedestrians suddenly emerging from behind parked cars or anticipating the acceleration patterns of nearby vehicles. Furthermore, RL enables autonomous vehicles to optimize their driving policies based on multiple objectives, for example, minimizing energy consumption while maintaining safety and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, autonomous vehicles are supposed to be designed to navigate real-world traffic interactions where human's unpredictability plays a major role. Shalev-Shwartz et al. emphasize that multi-agent RL techniques are essential to equip autonomous vehicles with the ability to interact with human drivers dynamically<a name=\"shalev\"></a><sup>[2]</sup>. For instance, when merging onto a highway, a self-driving car must balance confidence and caution. It faces to decide whether to yield or proceed based on the behavior of nearby vehicles. Similarly, in urban settings, an self-driving car must determine when it is appropriate to make an left turn based on the flow of oncoming traffic. Traditional models struggle with these dynamic interactions, which makes RL-based methods a promising direction for improving human-like driving behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "While RL has shown potential, one of its key limitations is the lack of interpretability in deep learning models. Unlike human drivers, we can explain their decisions based on rules and prior experiences. RL-based sel-driving cars operate like black-box systems, it is difficult to justify their actions in some critical situations. Kim et al. address this issue by developing a method for generating textual explanations for self-driving decisions. They use the attention-based deep learning models to highlight relevant visual cues that influenced the vehicle’s choices<a name=\"kim\"></a><sup>[3]</sup>. For example, an autonomous vehicle might explain its decision to slow down by stating: \"The vehicle is slowing down because a pedestrian is approaching the crosswalk\", which makes AI-driven decisions more transparent and trustworthy to human passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond technical challenges, public perception is also a crucial barrier to the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Schoettle and Sivak conducted a cross-national survey to examine public attitudes to self-driving technology in the U.S., U.K., and Australia<a name=\"schoettle\"></a><sup>[4]</sup>. Their findings indicate that even though many individuals support advancements of self-driving cars, a significant portion of respondents express concerns about safety, cybersecurity, and reliability. Notably, people are more comfortable with partial automation (e.g., lane-keeping assistance) but still remain skeptical of fully autonomous systems, which remove human control entirely. This skepticism is mainly caused by some incidents of high social interest, such as Tesla’s Autopilot-related crashes, which raise many questions about the readiness of this technology under real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another critical issue is the transition period, where human-driven cars and autonomous vehicles must share the road. Sivak and Schoettle warn that during this special phase, safety may initially decline because human drivers might struggle to anticipate self-driving cars' behaviors, and autonomous vehicles might fail to predict erratic human driving patterns as well<a name=\"sivak\"></a><sup>[5]</sup>. For example, human drivers often rely on eye contact or subtle hand gestures to negotiate with others about the right of the way.  Self-driving cars currently struggle to interpret it. Additionally, autonomous vehicles may obey too strictly to traffic rules. It potentially causes disruptions in environments where human drivers often follow by some informal rules, such as stops at empty intersections or road sides. These challenges highlight the need for gradual integration strategies to combine self-driving cars with V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communication systems to facilitate smoother coordination between human and autonomous vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study builds on prior work by testing AI models under dynamic driving conditions through using Webots, a simulation platform for autonomous vehicle research. We aim to identify the most effective strategies for ensuring safty and efficiecy of autonomous navigation. By integrating reinforcement learning techniques with explainable models, this project contributes to the development of autonomous vehicles that can solve to real-world driving challenges and also maintain interpretability and public trust."
